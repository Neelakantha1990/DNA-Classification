# DNA-Classification

Explored the world of bioinformatics by using 
a) Markov models
b)K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms 
c)support vector machines, and other common classifiers to classify short E. Coli DNA sequences. 

This project will use a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that has 106 DNA sequences, with 57 sequential nucleotides (“base-pairs”) each.

Steps Followed are:

-Imported data from the UCI repository:-https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/molecular-biology/promoter-gene-sequences/promoters.data
-Converted text inputs to numerical data
-Build and trained classification algorithms
-Compared and contrasted classification algorithms
